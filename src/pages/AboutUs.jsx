          <h3>Established - 1995</h3>
          <p>
            Ecomous was founded in 1995 by Julia Smith, a fashion lover with a passion for timeless design. 
            What started as a boutique idea in a studio apartment has grown into a global fashion brand. 
            Her mission was simple â€” to create clothes that make people feel confident and stylish. 
            From that vision in West London, Ecomous quickly became a local favorite.
